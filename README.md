# Telegram Wingpanel Icons

<p align="center"><img src="screenshot.png" /></p>

This project adds better-looking icons for the [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org/)
application to Pantheon Wingpanel (elementary OS).
I was inspired by the notification bell icon with its red dot as a signal that
there is something unread.

Tested on elementary OS 7.1 and Telegram Desktop 4.15.2.

From a particular time, Telegram Desktop started using a standard way of finding icons
provided by [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org/).
I don't know whether the old approach is still working or not.
I made this package just for fun and wanted to share it with others.


## Requirements

- Installed an Ayatana-like Wingpanel plugin for indicators.
  I find [wingpanel-community-indicators](https://github.com/MvBonin/wingpanel-community-indicators)
  to be the most fresh one.


## Installation

Download the latest deb-package from the release section and install it:

    sudo apt install ./telegram-wingpanel-icons.deb
